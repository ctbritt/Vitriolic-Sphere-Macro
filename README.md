##Modules required:

**Description:** Will cast vitriolic sphere and take care of 2nd round damage.

**Limitations:** Will need to delete the template manually at the end of the second round. The effect is attached to the template, so it will disappear too.

**Attribution:** Much help from [Otigon](https://github.com/otigon) and [Wasp](https://github.com/fantasycalendar)
