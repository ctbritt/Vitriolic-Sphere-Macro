# Vitriolic-Sphere-Macro
Simple sequencer macro for Vitriolic Sphere

## Modules required: 
- [Sequencer 2.0](https://github.com/fantasycalendar/FoundryVTT-Sequencer)
- [Midi-QOL](https://gitlab.com/tposney/midi-qol)
- [ItemMacro](https://github.com/Kekilla0/Item-Macro)

**Description:** Will cast vitriolic sphere and take care of 2nd round damage.

**Limitations:** Will need to delete the template manually at the end of the second round. The effect is attached to the template, so it will disappear too.

**Attribution:** Much help from [Otigon](https://github.com/otigon) and [Wasp](https://github.com/fantasycalendar)
